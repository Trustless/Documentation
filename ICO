We will develop primarily in Solidity using truffle and adopt ConsenSys mehodologies. The development community will seek out those creating Ethereum tokens.
We hope to gain developer sponsorships in the form of teams who require this management solution or parts thereof.

What it represents is their commitment to developing the code and using the code to deploy their own tokens using this system and the official Trustless registry.
